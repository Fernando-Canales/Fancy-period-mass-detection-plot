# Fancy-period-mass-detection-plot
In this repository I give a code made in a jupyter notebook in which I create a fancy period-mass plot of all the exoplanets confirmed so far. This plot also organizes the planets via detection method. All the data can be found in here https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/
